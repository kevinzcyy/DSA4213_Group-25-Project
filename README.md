# Bridging NER and Sentiment Analysis: Summarising Financial Events

This project explores the connection between **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Sentiment Analysis (SA)** in financial headlines.
By identifying key entities (e.g., companies, people, instruments) and analyzing sentiments around them, the project aims to generate concise summaries of financial events. This provides users with a clearer understanding of market-relevant information extracted from unstructured text.


## 📁 Project Structure

The project consists of a single Jupyter notebook:

```
Group 25_Project Code.ipynb
```

This notebook contains:

* Data preprocessing
* Named Entity Recognition
* Sentiment analysis modeling
* Event summarisation logic
* Evaluation and visualisations

All steps are self-contained in the notebook.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Open `Group 25_Project Code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
2.  Run the notebook *from top to bottom*.
3.  Ensure required Python libraries are installed (e.g., transformers, pandas, torch).

> *If running in Google Colab, install dependencies in the first cell using pip commands already provided in the notebook.*
